## Strategy

**Goal:** Deal passive damage → Cast a massive threat → Cascade into free value.

1.  **Passive Pingers:** We use "Group Slug" cards like *Descent into Avernus*, *Loyal Subordinate*, and *Theremo-Alchemist* to deal damage to opponents without combat. This turns on Abaddon's **Mark of Chaos Ascendant**.
2.  **Evasion is Key:** Cheap unblockable creatures (*Changeling Outcast*, *Slither Blade*) ensure we can trigger damage triggers even if the board is stalled, racking up the "X" value for cascade.
3.  **The Payoff:** Once opponents have lost life (e.g., 5-7 life), we cast high-CMC creatures (*Etali, Primal Storm*, *Ancient Copper Dragon*, *Hullbreaker Horror*). Abaddon gives these spells **Cascade**, letting us cheat out interaction, draw, or more creatures for free.
4.  **Stompy Finish:** We win by overwhelming the board with high-quality threats that cheated their way into play. *Warstorm Surge* and *Passionated Archaeologist* turn our casting into even more damage.

B3 — no infinites. **Game changers:** Rhystic Study, The One Ring, Ancient Copper Dragon. **Tutors:** Profane Tutor (cascades into it easily), Demonic Tutor.

## Key Synergies

- **Abaddon + Descent into Avernus:** *Descent* deals damage to everyone on your upkeep. By the time you draw, Abaddon already sees "X" damage dealt, giving your first spell instant Cascade.
- **Abaddon + Delayed Blast Fireball:** If you cascade into *Delayed Blast Fireball*, you cast it from exile, meaning it deals 5 damage to all opponents and their creatures (wiping small boards and racking up 15 damage for the *next* spell).
- **Free Spells:** *Profane Tutor*, *Wheel of Fate*, and *Inevitable Betrayal* have no mana cost. Cascading into them with a 3-drop is huge value.
- **Top Deck Manipulation:** *Brainstorm*, *Sensei's Divining Top*, and *Scroll Rack* let us set up the top of the library to ensure our Cascade hits gas, not a mana rock.
