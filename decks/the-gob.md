## Strategy

1. **Stick Krenko + haste him immediately** — Krenko taps to create X 1/1 Goblin tokens where X = Goblins you control. This is exponential: 5 → 10 → 20 → 40. Haste enablers: Lightning Greaves, Swiftfoot Boots, Mass Hysteria, Thousand-Year Elixir, Goblin Warchief, Battle Cry Goblin, Rising of the Day.
2. **Go wide with lords and pingers** — Lords (Chieftain, Warchief, Hobgoblin Bandit Lord, Trashmaster) pump the team. Purphoros (2 damage to each opponent per creature ETB) and Impact Tremors (1 per ETB) drain passively with every Krenko activation.
3. **Finish with combat or burn** — Shared Animosity / Coat of Arms make token swings lethal (20 goblins each get +19/+0). Burn: Goblin War Strike (damage = goblin count), Burn at the Stake (3× tapped creatures), Mob Justice (life loss = creature count). City on Fire triples all damage.

B3 — no infinites. **Game changers:** Purphoros, Shared Animosity, Coat of Arms. **Tutors:** Goblin Recruiter, Goblin Matron.

## Key Synergies

- **Krenko + haste + untap** — Tap immediately, then untap with Magewright's Stone, Umbral Mantle, or Thornbite Staff for multiple activations per turn.
- **Purphoros / Impact Tremors + Krenko** — 20 tokens = 40/20 damage to each opponent in one activation.
- **Skullclamp + 1/1 tokens** — equip → creature dies → draw 2. Broken card advantage engine.
- **Skirk Prospector + tokens** — sacrifice goblins for R each; fuels big turns.
- **Mana Echoes / Brightstone Ritual** — 20 goblins = 20+ mana. Enables casting your entire hand.
- **Shared Animosity / Coat of Arms** — 20 attacking goblins each get +19/+0. Lethal combat swings.
- **Goblin Recruiter → Conspicuous Snoop** — tutor any goblin to top of library, Snoop casts it.
- **Thornbite Staff on Krenko + Skirk Prospector** — any goblin dying untaps Krenko; sac 1 goblin for mana → untap → make more tokens → repeat.
- **Cloudstone Curio** — bounce goblins for re-ETB triggers (Purphoros, Impact Tremors, Siege-Gang Lieutenant).

## Notes

- **Mana base:** 30 lands (19 Mountain + 11 utility). Mono-red, heavy basics. Key utility: Cavern of Souls (uncounterable), Hanweir Battlements (haste), Command Beacon (dodge tax), Ancient Tomb (fast mana), Castle Embereth (pump), Buried Ruin (artifact recursion).
- **Krenko is 4 MV** — ramp with Sol Ring, Lotus Petal, Ruby Medallion, Arcane Signet, Ancient Tomb. T1 Sol Ring → T2 Krenko is the dream.
- **Protect Krenko at all costs** — without him the deck stalls. Greaves, Boots, Deflecting Swat, Goblin Chirurgeon (sac goblin to regenerate him).
- **Zariel, Archduke of Avernus** — only planeswalker. Provides haste + extra combat phase.
- **20+ artifacts** — heavy equipment/utility package; Thornbite Staff and Umbral Mantle are the key untap pieces.
