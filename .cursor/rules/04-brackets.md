# Commander Bracket System

The bracket system is a community-driven power level framework to help players find games at similar power levels. When building a deck, always ask (or infer) the target bracket.

## Bracket 1 — Casual / Introductory
**Vibe**: Precon-level or below. New player friendly. Games are slow, grindy, and about having fun.
**Characteristics**:
- No infinite combos
- No fast mana (Mana Crypt, Mana Vault, etc.) — Sol Ring is the exception
- No mass land destruction
- No hard stax/lockout pieces
- No free counterspells (Force of Will, Pact of Negation, etc.)
- Limited tutors (maybe 1-2 at most, and not for combos)
- Win through combat damage, big splashy spells, or slow value accumulation
- Average mana value: 3.5-4.5
- Games typically go 10+ turns

**Examples**: Upgraded precons, tribal decks with a casual build, theme decks, flavor builds

## Bracket 2 — Focused / Low-Power
**Vibe**: Clear strategy and synergies, but not cutthroat. Some powerful cards but no oppressive patterns.
**Characteristics**:
- May include some efficient mana rocks (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Fellwar Stone, talismans)
- Synergy-driven game plans but not heavy combo
- 2-card infinite combos are possible but not heavily tutored for — they happen naturally sometimes
- Some tutors allowed, typically limited in number
- Interaction is present but not oppressive
- May run a few powerful staples, but the deck isn't BUILT around them
- Average mana value: 3.0-3.8
- Games typically go 8-12 turns

**Examples**: Well-built tribal, strong synergy decks, commanders built "fair" 

## Bracket 3 — Optimized / High-Power
**Vibe**: Strong, deliberate decks with a clear optimized gameplan. This is where most enfranchised players land. Not full cEDH — no infinite-combo-or-bust, no tutor pile.
**Characteristics**:
- Full suite of fast mana
- **1–2 tutors max.** Bracket 3 standard is light tutoring — find a key piece or answer, not "tutor for the combo every game"
- **No infinite-combo focus.** Optimized gameplan plus **max 3 game changers** (haymakers / big impact cards that can swing or close games). Decks win through the plan and a few high-impact cards, not by tutoring into a two-card infinite
- Stax/tax pieces are acceptable (Rhystic Study, Smothering Tithe, Drannith Magistrate, etc.)
- Free counterspells (Force of Will, Fierce Guardianship, Deflecting Swat)
- Optimized mana bases — all relevant duals, fetches, shocks
- Interaction-heavy. Players are expected to hold up answers
- Average mana value: 2.5-3.2
- Games typically go 6-10 turns

**Examples**: Optimized value engines, control decks, well-tuned midrange, high-power thematic builds — not dedicated combo decks

## Bracket 4 — cEDH (Competitive EDH)
**Vibe**: Win as fast and consistently as possible. Every card earns its slot through raw power and efficiency.
**Characteristics**:
- Maximum fast mana density (every legal piece of fast mana that fits)
- Full tutor suite
- Win by turn 3-5 via infinite combo, usually with protection/backup
- Interaction is critical — counter wars are normal
- Stax is a viable full strategy (not just a few tax pieces)
- Card quality is absolute — no pet cards, no theme, pure optimization
- Average mana value: 1.8-2.5
- Games can end on any turn, but typically resolve by turn 4-6

**Examples**: Thoracle/Consultation decks, Turbo Naus, stax decks built to lock before anyone combos, meta-specific builds

## Using Brackets in Deckbuilding

- **Always clarify the target bracket** before recommending cards
- If a user wants to include a card that doesn't match their target bracket, let them know — but don't gatekeep. It's their deck
- When reviewing a decklist, note if any cards seem significantly above or below the target bracket
- Brackets are guidelines, not hard rules. Some playgroups define them differently. When in doubt, ask about the user's group
- A deck can straddle brackets — that's fine. The bracket is about general intent, not strict compliance
