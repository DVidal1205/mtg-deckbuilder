## Strategy

**Goal:** Ramp hard → Cast Xyris → Wheel (make 21+ snakes) → **Win immediately.**

1.  **Explosive Ramp:** Get Xyris out on Turn 3-4 using dorks, rocks, and land ramp.
2.  **Wheel into Army:** Cast a wheel (Windfall, Wheel of Fortune) to force opponents to draw. Xyris creates 3 snakes per opponent draw = 21 snakes from one wheel.
3.  **Haste & Combat:** Give the snakes haste (Rhythm of the Wild, Ogre Battledriver, Anger) and swing for lethal with buffs (Shared Animosity, Beastmaster Ascension).
4.  **Burn Option:** If combat is stalled, win via Purphoros/Impact Tremors/Goblin Bombardment triggers as the snakes enter.

**Key Pivot:** This is no longer a "durdle and draw" deck. It is an **explosive combo/aggro deck** that uses group hug mechanics to fuel a lethal engine.

B3 — no infinites. **Game changers:** Rhystic Study, The One Ring, Cyclonic Rift. **Tutors:** None.

## Key Synergies

- **Xyris + Wheels:** The core engine. 1 Wheel = ~21 Power on board.
- **Haste Enablers (Rhythm of the Wild, Fervor, Anger):** Turn those 21 snakes into immediate damage. **Crucial** for the strategy.
- **Ogre Battledriver:** Snakes enter as 3/1s with Haste. 21 snakes = 63 damage immediately.
- **Purphoros / Impact Tremors / Witty Roastmaster:** Turn wheel effects into direct burn. 21 snakes = 42 damage to each opponent with Purphoros.
- **Cryptolith Rite / Ashnod's Altar / Phyrexian Altar:** Turn snakes into massive mana to cast more wheels or finishers (Finale of Devastation).
- **The Locust God:** Redundancy for Xyris. Creates hasty flyers on draws.
- **Psychosis Crawler:** Drains opponents for every card you draw (which is a lot when you wheel).

## Notes

- **Mana base:** 36 lands. Optimized for speed and fixing.
- **Creature heavy:** Shifted focus to creature-based effects for better synergy with Beast Whisperer/Guardian Project.
- **Minimal Instants/Sorceries:** Only the essentials (Wheels, Interaction, heavy Ramp).
- **Sacrifice Outlets:** Goblin Bombardment, Ashnod's Altar, Phyrexian Altar provide value if board wiped.
