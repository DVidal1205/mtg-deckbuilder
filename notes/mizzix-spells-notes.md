# Mizzix - Spells — Playtest Notes

## 2026-02-14 — [Session Type: Online/LGS/Casual Night]
**Pod**: 2 other control decks, 1 token deck (name forgotten)
**Result**: 
**Observations**:
- **What worked well**: Deck felt REALLY good in this game. Cards were on the table, discount was out, was spell slinging effectively. The control matchup allowed the deck to operate at full capacity.
- **What underperformed**: 
- **Cards that were dead in hand**: 
- **Cards that overperformed**: 
- **Matchup-specific notes**: Felt strong against other control decks - the spell-slinging engine was firing on all cylinders
- **Changes to consider**:

**Pod**: 
**Result**: 
**Observations**:
- **What worked well**: 
- **What underperformed**: Really shitty draw throughout the game. Commander (Mizzix) was offline the ENTIRE game. Got him out, then board wiped, and exhausted all instant/sorcery spells - bringing him out again would be useless since can't accrue experience counters without spells in hand.
- **Cards that were dead in hand**: 
- **Cards that overperformed**: 
- **Matchup-specific notes**: 
- **Changes to consider**: Definitely have a bit of a draw difficulty. Need more card draw or filtering to ensure Mizzix can accrue experience counters even after board wipes. Consider adding more card draw spells or ways to refill hand after being wiped.
