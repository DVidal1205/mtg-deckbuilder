## Strategy

1. **Stick Mister Negative + protect him** — His ability inverts life changes: your life gain = opponents lose life; your life loss = opponents gain life. Protect with Cloudshift, Ephemerate, Restoration Angel (blink dodges removal), plus Greaves-type effects if added.
2. **Drain via life gain** — Vito, Sanguine Bond, Sheoldred, and Gray Merchant all trigger massive drain with Negative out. Use life loss as a resource: Peer into the Abyss (draw half library), Bolas's Citadel (cast from top), K'rrik (pay life for mana), Vilis (draw on life loss). Opponents gain life but you get massive card advantage.
3. **Finish with combo or grind** — Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond = infinite drain. Repay in Kind / Axis of Mortality for life total swaps. Bloodletter of Aclazotz doubles life gain (doubles drain). Tainted Remedy locks opponents out of gaining life.

B3 — Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond is a 2-card infinite if assembled; both are strong individually. **Game changers:** The One Ring, Sheoldred, Bolas's Citadel. **Tutors:** None (relies on draw/grind).

## Key Synergies

- **Negative + any life gain** — opponents lose that much. Vito, Sanguine Bond, and Sheoldred all stack for multi-layered drain.
- **Exquisite Blood + Sanguine Bond** — infinite drain loop (you gain 1 → opponent loses 1 → Exquisite triggers → repeat).
- **Tainted Remedy** — opponents can't gain life; if they would, they lose it. Soft-lock with Negative.
- **Peer into the Abyss** — lose half life (opponents gain it with Negative) but draw half library. Massive card advantage trade-off.
- **Bolas's Citadel / K'rrik** — pay life to cast/ramp. Opponents gain life, but you're cheating mana costs.
- **Vilis** — draw cards whenever you lose life. With Negative, opponents gain life, but you refill hand.
- **The One Ring** — burden counter life loss with Negative out becomes drain on opponents.
- **Bloodletter of Aclazotz** — doubles life gain → doubles drain with Negative.
- **Panharmonicon** — doubles ETB triggers (Gray Merchant drains twice, blink creatures double).
- **Pain lands** (City of Brass, Mana Confluence, Tarnished Citadel) — life loss for mana; with Negative, opponents gain life, but it's free mana fixing.

## Notes

- **Mana base:** 39 lands (6 Plains, 10 Swamp, 23 nonbasic). Duals: Scrubland, Godless Shrine, Isolated Chapel, Vault of Champions. Fetches: Marsh Flats, Prismatic Vista, Bleachbone Verge. Heavy on pain lands which synergize with Negative's inversion.
- **Negative is 4 MV** — ramp with Sol Ring, Dark Ritual, K'rrik, Ancient Tomb, Arcane Signet.
- **Blink package** for protection + value: Cloudshift, Ephemerate, Restoration Angel, Felidar Guardian, Teleportation Circle. Blinking Negative dodges removal and re-triggers ETBs on other creatures.
- **Weak to edicts** (sacrifice effects) — no way to dodge those except having extra creatures on board.
