## Strategy

1. **Stick Toph** — Lands become artifacts. Every land drop creates a 3/3 Golem. Ramp early (Sol Ring, Mox Opal, Lotus Petal, Chromatic Lantern) and protect her (Swiftfoot Boots, Heroic Intervention, Deflecting Swat, Flawless Maneuver).
2. **Stack landfall + artifact synergies** — Extra land drops (Exploration, Azusa, Dryad of the Ilysian Grove) multiply Golem production. Field of the Dead adds Zombies. Scute Swarm, Felidar Retreat, and Omnath layer additional triggers. Evolution Sage proliferates counters on every landfall.
3. **Close the game** — Moraug gives extra combats on landfall. Omnath bolts on elemental death. All Will Be One + Evolution Sage creates a damage engine. Swing with a massive token army buffed by counter synergies.

B3 — no infinites. **Game changers:** Gaea's Cradle, The One Ring, Field of the Dead. **Tutors:** Sylvan Scrying, Expedition Map, Goblin Engineer.

## Key Synergies

- **Toph + Roaming Throne** (choose Avatar) — double Golem triggers per land drop.
- **Toph + Ashaya** — all creatures become lands AND artifacts. Artifact tutors find creatures.
- **Extra land drops** (Exploration, Azusa, Dryad) — multiple Golems per turn. Feeds all landfall engines.
- **Field of the Dead + Toph** — 2 tokens per landfall (Zombie + Golem) once at 7+ unique land names.
- **Evolution Sage + All Will Be One** — landfall → proliferate → deal damage equal to counters placed.
- **Liquimetal Coating / Torque** — turn opponents' permanents into artifacts for removal via artifact hate.
- **Wake the Past** — returns ALL artifacts from GY, which includes every land with Toph out.
- **Gaea's Cradle + token army** — massive mana; 20 tokens = 20 green mana.
- **The Ozolith + Resourceful Defense** — preserve counters when creatures die; nothing is wasted.

## Notes

- **Mana base:** 36 lands (2 Mountain, 3 Plains, 5 Forest + 26 nonbasic). Lands ARE the strategy so the count matters. Key: Gaea's Cradle, Field of the Dead, Inkmoth Nexus (infect backup), Boseiju (removal on a land).
- **Duals/fetches:** Original duals: Plateau, Savannah, Taiga. Shocks: Sacred Foundry, Temple Garden, Stomping Ground. Check lands: Canopy Vista, Cinder Glade. Bond land: Spire Garden. Reveal lands: Fortified Village, Game Trail. Fetches: Arid Mesa, Wooded Foothills, Windswept Heath — each fetch triggers Toph twice (fetch land + fetched land).
- **Toph is 5 MV** — prioritize early ramp. Sol Ring T1 → Toph T3 is the ideal line.
- **Protect Toph:** Swiftfoot Boots, Heroic Intervention, Flawless Maneuver, Deflecting Swat, Sylvan Safekeeper (sac land for shroud — land goes to GY for Conduit of Worlds / Wake the Past).

## Changes from Original

**Cuts:**
- Bag of Holding (weak card draw)
- Sabotender (weak landfall payoff)
- Tannuk, Memorial Ensign (weak landfall payoff)
- Avatar Kyoshi, Earthbender (too expensive at 8 mana)
- Scrap Trawler (narrow artifact recursion)
- Hour of Revelation (expensive conditional board wipe)
- Earthbending Student (weak body, redundant earthbend)
- Toph, Greatest Earthbender (redundant with other Toph cards)

**Additions:**
- Exploration (extra land drop)
- Azusa, Lost but Seeking (two extra land drops)
- Oracle of Mul Daya (extra land drop + play from top)
- Tireless Tracker (landfall card draw engine)
- Tireless Provisioner (landfall mana acceleration)

**Landbase Refinements:**
- Removed: Lotus Field, Buried Ruin, Vesuva (3 utility lands)
- Added: Stomping Ground (shock RG), Canopy Vista (check GW), Cinder Glade (check RG), Spire Garden (bond RG), Fortified Village (reveal GW), Game Trail (reveal RG) (6 duals)
- Adjusted basics: 2 Mountain, 3 Plains, 5 Forest (was 2/4/4) — more green sources, fewer white
- Total lands: 33 → 36 (better color fixing, minimal life payment)
