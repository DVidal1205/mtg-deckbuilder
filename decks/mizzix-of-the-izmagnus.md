## Strategy

**Game plan (3 steps):**

1. **Get Mizzix on the board** — Ramp and stick the commander.
2. **Cast control instants/sorceries and pump experience; protect Mizzix** — Counters, removal, and cantrips grow her experience (staircase: cast MV 1 → 2 → 3 …). Greaves/Boots, Deflecting Swat, Fierce Guardianship, and countermagic keep her alive. While we do this, **ping engines** (Guttersnipe, Vivi, Electrostatic Field, Niv-Mizzet Parun; doubled by Veyran) bleed the table — every spell we cast to control the game also drains opponents.
3. **By the time we’re big, they’re pinged and bled** — Then we finish with a big X spell (Comet Storm, Crackle with Power, Jaya’s Immolating Inferno) or Aetherflux / Blue Sun’s Zenith.

No infinite combos; B3 = max 3 game changers, 1–2 tutors. **Game changers (DB):** Rhystic Study, Fierce Guardianship, Cyclonic Rift. **Tutors:** Merchant Scroll (1).

## Key synergies

- **Staircase:** Cast MV 1 → get 1 exp, MV 2 → 2 exp, … so we always have a spell that grows the counter. Big spells (5–7+) are there to both grow experience and become cheap later.
- **X spells + discount:** With 8 experience, Comet Storm (XRR) costs RR for X=8; Blue Sun’s Zenith (XUUU) costs UUU for X=8. We run many X spells so we always have a huge payoff once we’re stacked.
- Baral + counters; Rhystic / Remora for card advantage.

## Deck breakdown

**Counterspells (~15):** Pact of Negation, Flusterstorm, Counterspell, Mana Drain, Negate, Pyroblast, Red Elemental Blast, Deflecting Swat, Disallow, Fierce Guardianship, Narset's Reversal, Rewind, Mindswipe, Izzet Charm (modal: soft counter / 2 damage / loot 2). Solid Izzet counter suite — you can hold up interaction and still advance.

**Removal (~7):** Lightning Bolt, Abrade, Chaos Warp, Cyclonic Rift, Flame of Anor, Vandalblast, Blasphemous Act (wipe). Enough to answer creatures, artifacts, and key permanents; Rift and Blasphemous Act for resets.

**Protection for Mizzix:** Lightning Greaves + Swiftfoot Boots (shroud/hexproof + haste), Deflecting Swat (redirect removal at her), Fierce Guardianship (free counter when she’s out). Counterspells protect her on the stack. **Command Beacon** lets you put her back to hand once so you can recast without tax if she’s been killed a bunch. Weak to edicts (sacrifice) — no way to protect from those except having other creatures (tokens help).

**Ping / bleed (gradual damage):** **Guttersnipe** (2 to each opponent per instant/sorcery). **Vivi Ornitier** (1 to each per noncreature + grows + mana = power once/turn). **Electrostatic Field** (1 to each per instant/sorcery). **Niv-Mizzet, Parun** (1 to any target whenever we draw). **Veyran, Voice of Duality** doubles all of these triggers — so with Veyran + Guttersnipe = 4 to each per spell; Veyran + Vivi + Field = 4 to each per spell. By the time Mizzix is stacked, the table is already low; then we big-finish.

**Finishers:** **Comet Storm**, **Crackle with Power** (5×X to each of up to X targets), **Jaya's Immolating Inferno**, **Braingeyser** (XUU: target player draws X — draw or deck); **Aetherflux Reservoir** (pay 50 to deal 50); **Blue Sun's Zenith** (deck one opponent). **Mizzix's Mastery** (overload: recast every instant/sorcery in your graveyard — big second wave or finisher). **Mystic Retrieval** (flashback: cheap single rebuy from yard).

**Tokens (chump blockers):** Young Pyromancer and Third Path Iconoclast — every instant/sorcery makes a 1/1. **Ral, Monsoon Mage** — 1R, instants/sorceries cost {1} less; each one on your turn = coin flip, win = flip to Ral, Leyline Prodigy (planeswalker). **Storm-Kiln Artist** — Treasure per instant/sorcery (ramp + artifact count; he gets +1/+0 per artifact so can block better). **Archmage Emeritus** — draw whenever you cast or copy an instant/sorcery (2/2 body). **Niv-Mizzet, Parun** — 5/5 flying, can't be countered; draw on instant/sorcery cast, ping 1 when we draw. **Vivi Ornitier**, **Electrostatic Field**, **Veyran, Voice of Duality** round out the creature suite (ping + trigger doubling). Twelve creatures total = bodies for chumping and edict protection.

## Gems from other builds (consider)

From the Mizzix dragon / spellslinger list, these fit our control build and we’re not running yet:

| Card | Why it’s good |
|------|----------------|
| **Archmage Emeritus** | Magecraft: whenever you cast or copy an instant/sorcery, draw a card. We cast a ton of spells — this is a huge draw engine. 4 CMC, fits staircase. |
| **Rewind** | Counter target spell, untap up to four lands. With Mizzix discount often “UU, counter, untap 4” — keep mana up after countering. |
| **Birgi, God of Storytelling** | Whenever you cast a spell, add R (doesn’t empty). Turns every spell into a ritual; back side Harnfel is card advantage. |
| **Storm-Kiln Artist** | Magecraft: create a Treasure whenever you cast or copy an instant/sorcery. Ramp + artifact count; stacks with our token makers. |
| **The One Ring** | Draw engine + “protection from everything” for a turn. Format staple; fits any control deck. |
| **Cloud Key** | As enters, choose instant or sorcery; that type costs {1} less. Second cost reducer alongside Mizzix. |
| **Double Vision** | First instant or sorcery each turn is copied. Copy Comet Storm, Counterspell, draw spells. 5 CMC staircase. |
| **Aetherize** | Return all attacking creatures to their owner’s hand. One-sided fog for alpha strikes; good for surviving. |
| **Ruby Medallion** / **Sapphire Medallion** | Red or blue spells cost {1} less. We’re heavy blue; Sapphire does more work; Ruby helps red X spells. |
| **Fabricate** | Tutor artifact (Greaves, Boots, Sol Ring, etc.). We’re at 2 tutors; this is a third, artifact-only. |
| **Seething Song** | 2R → RRRRR. Ritual for burst (early Mizzix or big X). Optional. |

**Skip for our build:** Pyromancer Ascension (needs duplicate spell names in gy — bad in singleton), Thrumming Stone / Dragon’s Approach (dragon theme).

## Gems from Vivi list (friend’s deck)

Cards from the Vivi Ornitier list that fit Mizzix and are in our DB:

| Card | Why it’s good |
|------|----------------|
| **Vivi Ornitier** | 1UR, 0/3 Wizard. Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, put a +1/+1 counter on Vivi and he deals 1 damage to each opponent. {0}: Add X U and/or R (X = Vivi’s power), once per turn on your turn. So he’s another “ping each opponent per spell,” grows, then gives mana = power. Wizard for Flame of Anor. **Solid add.** |
| **Veyran, Voice of Duality** | 1UR, 2/2. Magecraft: Veyran gets +1/+1. **If casting/copying an instant or sorcery causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, it triggers an additional time.** So Guttersnipe = 4 to each per spell, Archmage = draw 2, Storm-Kiln = 2 Treasures, Niv = draw 2 + ping 2. Huge multiplier. **Top pick.** |
| **Balmor, Battlemage Captain** | UR, 1/3 flying. Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery, creatures you control get +1/+0 and trample until EOT. Turns our 1/1 tokens into a real combat clock (and they stack each spell). |
| **Electrostatic Field** | 1R, 0/4 defender. Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery, Field deals 1 damage to each opponent. Half a Guttersnipe but stacks (Guttersnipe + Field = 3 to each per spell). |
| **Ojer Axonil, Deepest Might** | 2RR. If a red source you control would deal less than Ojer’s power (4) to an opponent, it deals 4 instead. So Guttersnipe 2→4, Electrostatic 1→4, Vivi 1→4. Amplifies all our pings. |
| **Torbran, Thane of Red Fell** | 1RRR. Red sources you control deal 2 extra damage to opponents or their permanents. Guttersnipe 2→4, etc. |
| **Hullbreaker Horror** | 5UU, 7/8 flash, can’t be countered. Whenever you cast a spell, bounce a spell or nonland permanent. Strong but 7 CMC. |
| **Rewind** | 2UU, counter target spell, untap up to four lands. With Mizzix often “UU, counter, keep mana up.” (Also in dragon gems.) |
| **Curiosity / Ophidian Eye** | Enchant creature: whenever it deals damage to an opponent, draw a card. On **Niv-Mizzet, Parun**: we draw → Niv pings → Curiosity triggers → we draw → repeat = **infinite draw + damage**. We’re not building for infinites (B3), but it’s a 2-card “oops I win” if you’re okay including it. |

**Skip for Mizzix control:** Lier, Disciple of the Drowned (gives all instants/sorceries flashback but **spells can’t be countered** — we want to run counters). **Ral, Monsoon Mage** we run (friend's pick): 1R creature, instants/sorceries cost {1} less; flip a coin on each instant/sorcery on your turn — win = flip to planeswalker (cost reduction, −2 damage+draw, −8 free cast from top 8). Cut Izzet Charm for him.

**Not in DB / FF-only names:** Many lands and spells from the list (e.g. Agna Qel'a, Lindblum, Bender's Waterskin, Starting Town, some instants) may be FF or other UB; our DB is de-duplicated by name→oracle so some won’t appear. If you have a specific name, we can try a fuzzy search.

## EDHREC audit (guidance, not source of truth)

EDHREC aggregates all Mizzix decks (combo, storm, control, etc.); our source of truth is **this deck’s game plan** (control → pump experience + ping bleed → big finisher). Used EDHREC to find options that support that plan:

**Added for our plan:** **Frantic Search** (filter + untap 3; 3 CMC experience, hold up more mana). **Tezzeret's Gambit** (proliferate = add experience counters to Mizzix, draw 2). **Flux Channeler** (proliferate on every noncreature spell; Wizard). **Rewind** (counter + untap 4; keep mana up). **Vandalblast** (artifact wipe; we had no mass artifact answer). **Reliquary Tower** (no max hand size; we draw a lot).

**Cut to make room:** Opt, Delay, Prismari Command, Pull from Tomorrow, Commune with Lava, Reflecting Pool (swap for Reliquary Tower). Lower impact or redundant for our control + ping plan.

**Not added (EDHREC-popular but wrong fit for this build):** Reiterate / Past in Flames (storm combo), Thousand-Year Storm (storm), extra tutors (we keep 1–2 for B3), Mana Geyser / Seething Song (ritual all-in; we’re gradual ping then finisher). **Mizzix's Mastery** we run as a big recast turn / finisher. **Mystic Retrieval** kept for flashback (cheap single rebuy); cut Experimental Augury for Mastery.

## Notes

- **No Jeweled Lotus** — banned in Commander.
- **Curve:** Staircase (1–2–3–4–5–6–7+) so we always have a spell that grows experience; X spells get a huge discount and close games.
- **Bender's Waterskin:** {3} artifact, taps for any color; untaps during each other player's untap step → always have 1 mana of any color up for counters on opponents' turns (cut Mind Stone).
- **Mana base:** 37 lands. Cost split 60% U / 40% R → 12 Island, 9 Mountain, **10 UR duals** (Volcanic Island, Steam Vents, Command Tower, Training Center, Sulfur Falls, Spirebluff Canal, Frostboil Snarl, Cascade Bluffs, Fiery Islet, Riverglide Pathway). **2 fetches** (Scalding Tarn, Prismatic Vista) — no off-color fetches (Strand/Rainforest/Delta only get Island for us, so pay 1 life for no extra value). Utility: Command Beacon, Mystic Sanctuary, Otawara, Reliquary Tower.
