## Strategy

**Game plan:** Counters, counters, more counters. Merfolk tribal with a stacked board; protect Hakbal and the team, ramp hard, close with unblockable +1/+1 armies or Simic value.

1. **Ramp and stick Hakbal** — Fast mana + green land ramp. Get Hakbal down and keep him safe (Greaves, Boots, Tamiyo's Safekeeping, Snakeskin Veil, Heroic Intervention, Veil of Summer, countermagic).
2. **Every combat = explore** — Each Merfolk explores on your combat step; lands to hand or +1/+1 counters. Hardened Scales, Branching Evolution, Doubling Season, and both Ozoliths amplify. Play merfolk, attack, grow.
3. **Protect the stack** — Counterspells (Force of Will, Counterspell, Mana Drain, Pact of Negation, Negate, Disallow, Daze, Flusterstorm) protect Hakbal and key pieces. When Hakbal attacks: put a land into play or draw. Either way you're ahead.
4. **Close the game** — Herald of Secret Streams makes stacked merfolk unblockable. Kumena, Seafloor Oracle, Cold-Eyed Selkie, and Thrasios/Tishana draw piles. Cyclonic Rift for a one-sided reset; then swing.

No infinite combos. **B3:** max 3 game changers, 1–2 tutors. **Game changers (DB):** Rhystic Study, Cyclonic Rift, The One Ring (draw + "protection from everything" for a turn; swapped from Force of Will for more draw impact). **Tutor:** Green Sun's Zenith (1).

## Key synergies

- **Hakbal + explore** — Every merfolk explores each combat; +1/+1 counters or land to hand. Nicanzil, Current Conductor doubles explore and is a merfolk; Topography Tracker and Deeproot Elite love counters.
- **Counter doublers** — Hardened Scales, Branching Evolution, Doubling Season, The Earth Crystal (also green cost reducer), Ozolith (Shattered Spire). The Ozolith moves counters when things die so you don't lose investment.
- **Landfall proliferate** — Evolution Sage: every land drop = proliferate = another +1/+1 on everything that already has counters. Extra land drops (Exploration, Azusa) feed both Hakbal's explore→land-to-hand and Evolution Sage.
- **Tribal copy** — Reflections of Littjara (choose Merfolk): whenever you cast a merfolk spell, copy it (copy of a permanent spell becomes a token). Double every merfolk you cast.
- **Proliferate + phase** — **Ripples of Potential**: proliferate, then permanents that got a counter from that phase out (protection + counters in one shot).
- **Flying for the board** — **Wonder** (3U): in graveyard + you control an Island → all your creatures have flying. Get it in the yard (loot, mill, or chump block) to block flyers and attack in the air.
- **Lords + unblockable** — Master of the Pearl Trident, Lord of Atlantis, Merfolk Sovereign, Svyelun, Kopala. Herald of Secret Streams makes creatures with +1/+1 counters unblockable = lethal out of nowhere.
- **Protection** — Lightning Greaves, Swiftfoot Boots, instant-speed hexproof/indestructible (Tamiyo's Safekeeping, Snakeskin Veil, Heroic Intervention, Veil of Summer). Plaza of Heroes for commander tax help.
- **Value / draw** — **Kindred Discovery** (choose Merfolk: whenever a merfolk enters or attacks, draw). **Beast Whisperer** (whenever you cast a creature spell, draw). **Mystic Remora** (early-game draw when opponents cast noncreature). Seafloor Oracle (draw on merfolk combat damage), Cold-Eyed Selkie, Kumena, Thrasios, Tishana. **Rhystic Study** and **The One Ring** (tap: draw for each burden counter; ETB = protection from everything until your next turn) as game-changer draw.

## Deck breakdown

**Merfolk (~25) + landfall/ramp:** Hakbal, Nicanzil, Herald of Secret Streams, Kumena, Seafloor Oracle, Cold-Eyed Selkie, Singer of Swift Rivers, Deeproot Elite, Master of the Pearl Trident, Svyelun of Sea and Sky, Merrow Reejerey, Merfolk Sovereign, Kopala, Emperor Mihail II, Topography Tracker, Vorel of the Hull Clade, Zegana Utopian Speaker, Tishana Voice of Thunder, Thrasios Triton Hero, Lord of Atlantis, Merfolk Skydiver, Metallic Mimic (name Merfolk). **Evolution Sage** (landfall → proliferate). **Azusa, Lost but Seeking** (two extra lands per turn).

**Counter enablers:** Hardened Scales, Branching Evolution, Doubling Season, The Earth Crystal, The Ozolith, Ozolith the Shattered Spire, Inspiring Call (indestructible + draw). **Reflections of Littjara** (choose Merfolk → copy merfolk spells as tokens). **Ripples of Potential** (1U): proliferate, then any permanents that got a counter from that proliferate phase out (protection + counters). **Wonder** (3U): in graveyard + you control an Island → all your creatures have flying (block flyers, attack in the air). **Kodama of the West Tree** (reach; modified creatures = trample, and "modified" includes +1/+1 counters; land on combat damage). **Simic Ascendancy** (1GU: put +1/+1 on creature; growth counters = +1/+1 put on your creatures; 20+ growth = you win). **Overwhelming Stampede** (sorcery: creatures get +X/+X and trample, X = greatest power among your creatures — one-shot finisher).

**Protection for Hakbal:** **Equipment** — Lightning Greaves (haste + shroud), Swiftfoot Boots (haste + hexproof). **Instants** — Tamiyo's Safekeeping (G: target permanent hexproof + indestructible), Snakeskin Veil (G: +1/+1 and hexproof on target creature), Heroic Intervention (1G: all your permanents hexproof + indestructible until EOT), Veil of Summer (G: hexproof from blue/black, draw if you countered one). **Other** — The One Ring (ETB: you get protection from everything until your next turn), Plaza of Heroes (helps pay commander tax). **On the stack** — Counterspell, Mana Drain, Pact of Negation. (No redirect like Deflecting Swat — we're GU.)

**Ramp / extra lands:** Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Fellwar Stone, Talisman of Curiosity, Lotus Petal, Nature's Lore, Three Visits, Farseek, Cultivate, Kodama's Reach. **Exploration**, **Azusa** (additional land(s) per turn — use with Hakbal explore putting lands in hand).

**Removal:** Cyclonic Rift, Beast Within, Pongify.

## Notes

- **No Jeweled Lotus** — Banned in Commander.
- **Mana base:** 36 lands. GU ~50/50; fetches (Misty Rainforest, Verdant Catacombs, Prismatic Vista) + Breeding Pool, Command Tower, Hinterland Harbor, Temple of Mystery, Yavimaya Coast, Botanical Sanctum, Plaza of Heroes, Otawara, Reliquary Tower. Basics to support Nature's Lore / Three Visits / Farseek.
- **Green Sun's Zenith:** Finds any green creature — e.g. Dryad Arbor (if added), Nicanzil, Kodama of the West Tree, Evolution Sage, or utility. Use for key merfolk or blocker as needed.
- **Sin, Unending Cataclysm** (5GU): Leviathan. Flying, trample. ETB: remove all counters from any number of artifacts/creatures/enchantments; Sin enters with X +1/+1 counters (X = twice the number removed). When Sin dies, put its counters on a creature you control, then shuffle Sin into library. Your counter-stack finisher.
