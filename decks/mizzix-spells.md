## Strategy

1. **Stick Mizzix, build experience via staircase** — Cast MV 1 → 2 → 3… to accumulate experience counters. Protect with Greaves, Boots, Deflecting Swat, Fierce Guardianship, and the counter suite.
2. **Control the board while pingers bleed the table** — 15 counterspells + targeted removal keep the board in check. Meanwhile, Guttersnipe (2 to each per spell), Vivi Ornitier (1 to each per noncreature), Electrostatic Field (1 to each per spell), and Niv-Mizzet Parun (ping on draw) drain passively. Veyran doubles ALL these triggers.
3. **Finish with big X spells** — Once experience is stacked, Comet Storm costs RR for X=8, Crackle with Power deals 5×X, Blue Sun's Zenith decks opponents. Aetherflux Reservoir at 50+ life deals 50. Mizzix's Mastery (overload) recasts your entire GY as a lethal second wave.

B3 — no infinites. **Game changers:** Rhystic Study, Fierce Guardianship, Cyclonic Rift. **Tutors:** Merchant Scroll.

## Key Synergies

- **Mizzix experience + X spells** — 8 experience → Comet Storm costs RR for X=8; Blue Sun's Zenith costs UUU for X=8. Every experience counter is permanent value.
- **Veyran doubles ALL spell triggers** — Guttersnipe 2→4, Electrostatic Field 1→2, Storm-Kiln 1→2 Treasures, Niv-Mizzet draw 1→2. Massive multiplier.
- **Guttersnipe + Field + Veyran** — 6 damage to each opponent per spell cast. The table dies to your control spells.
- **Niv-Mizzet, Parun** — draws on EVERY instant/sorcery cast (yours AND opponents'), pings on each draw. Can't be countered.
- **Storm-Kiln Artist** — Treasure per spell. Ramp engine that funds big X turns.
- **Flux Channeler** — proliferate on every noncreature spell. Grows Mizzix experience counters directly.
- **Young Pyromancer / Third Path Iconoclast** — 1/1 tokens for blockers + edict protection.
- **Mizzix's Mastery (overload)** — recast entire GY. Finisher or recovery after a long grind game.
- **Bender's Waterskin** — untaps during each opponent's untap step. Always have mana for countermagic.

## Notes

- **Mana base:** 37 lands (12 Island, 9 Mountain, 16 nonbasic). 60/40 blue/red split. Key: Volcanic Island, Steam Vents, Mystic Sanctuary (rebuy top instant/sorcery), Command Beacon (dodge commander tax).
- **15 counterspells** — this is a control deck first, finisher deck second. Hold up interaction and advance with pingers simultaneously.
- **Protect Mizzix:** Greaves, Boots, Deflecting Swat, Fierce Guardianship + the counter suite. Losing experience counters is devastating.
- **Bender's Waterskin** replaces Mind Stone — untaps on each opponent's untap step so you always have 1 mana for counters on opponents' turns.
- **Ral, Monsoon Mage** — 1R creature, instants/sorceries cost {1} less. Coin flip each spell on your turn to flip into a planeswalker.
