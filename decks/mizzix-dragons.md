## Strategy

1. **Stick Mizzix, build experience** — Cast spells in staircase order (MV 1 → 2 → 3…) to grow experience counters. Mizzix discounts all instants/sorceries by experience count.
2. **Dragon's Approach storm** — Resolve Thrumming Stone → cast one of 20 Dragon's Approaches → ripple chains through the deck. Each Approach deals 3 to each opponent (20 copies = 60 damage). Pyromancer Ascension (trivial to activate with duplicate Approaches) doubles every spell. Birgi and Storm-Kiln Artist generate mana to sustain the chain.
3. **Finish with burn or dragons** — Storm damage usually kills. If not, Approach tutors Ancient Silver Dragon or Ancient Copper Dragon. X spells (Blue Sun's Zenith, Stroke of Genius) can deck opponents with Mizzix discount.

B3 — no infinites. **Game changers:** Rhystic Study, Force of Will, The One Ring. **Tutors:** Fabricate (finds Thrumming Stone).

## Key Synergies

- **Thrumming Stone + Dragon's Approach** — cast 1 Approach → ripple reveals all 20 → cast for free → each deals 3 to each opponent. Core engine.
- **Pyromancer Ascension** — cast 2 Approaches → Ascension active → every spell is doubled. Trivial to turn on.
- **Mizzix experience + cost reducers** (Cloud Key, Ruby Medallion, Baral) — stack discounts; Approach becomes R or free.
- **Birgi / Storm-Kiln Artist** — R per spell cast / Treasure per instant/sorcery. Keeps the chain mana-positive.
- **Double Vision** — copies first spell each turn. Copy an Approach or a big draw spell.
- **Niv-Mizzet variants** — draw + ping while storming. Parun draws on every instant/sorcery cast (yours AND opponents').
- **Guttersnipe + Veyran** — 4 damage to each opponent per spell (Veyran doubles Guttersnipe's trigger).
- **Mizzix's Mastery (overload)** — recast all instants/sorceries from GY. Second storm wave after the main chain.

## Notes

- **Mana base:** 36 lands (6 Island, 15 Mountain, 15 nonbasic). UR duals: Steam Vents, Training Center, Sulfur Falls, Cascade Bluffs, Fiery Islet, Shivan Reef, Frostboil Snarl, Stormcarved Coast, Thundering Falls, Riverglide Pathway, Riverpyre Verge. Fetches: Scalding Tarn, Prismatic Vista.
- **Sea Gate Restoration** is a sorcery (MDFC with land back) — counted as sorcery, not land.
- **Rowan, Scholar of Sparks** is the only planeswalker.
- **20 Dragon's Approach** copies break singleton but the card is designed for it. 20 is the sweet spot for Thrumming Stone chains.
- **Thrumming Stone is THE key piece** — Fabricate finds it. Protect it. Without it, cast Approaches manually and leverage Pyromancer Ascension + cost reduction.
- **Artist's Talent** — enchantment for card filtering; helps find Thrumming Stone or key pieces.
