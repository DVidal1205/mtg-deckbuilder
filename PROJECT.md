This repository serves as the home for my AI experimentation with Magic the Gathering Deckbuilding.

The goal of this is to create a Cursor setup that will turn the typical coding workflow into a streamlined deckbuilding workflow.

To accomplish this, we aim to use the following tools:

-   Cursor Rules
-   Tools / Tool Calling
-   Local Database from Scryfall Bulk Data
-   Fully local card data and search functionality
-   Utilize EDHRec API for card details and synergy
-   Utilize LLM for card search and recommendation
