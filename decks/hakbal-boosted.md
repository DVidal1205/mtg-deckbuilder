## Strategy

### Core Game Plan

1. **Ramp and stick Hakbal** — Fast mana + green land ramp. Protect with Greaves, Boots, Tamiyo's Safekeeping, Snakeskin Veil, Heroic Intervention, Veil of Summer, and countermagic (Counterspell, Mana Drain, Pact of Negation).
2. **Attack → every Merfolk explores** — Each combat, every Merfolk gets +1/+1 or draws a land. Counter doublers (Hardened Scales, Branching Evolution, Doubling Season) and Ozoliths amplify growth. Evolution Sage proliferates on every land drop. Topography Tracker and Nicanzil double explore triggers.
3. **Close the game** — Herald of Secret Streams makes creatures with +1/+1 counters unblockable. Overwhelming Stampede gives +X/+X and trample to the team. Alternatively, grind with Kindred Discovery + Rhystic Study card advantage into a massive board, or win via Simic Ascendancy.

### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown

**Early Game (Turns 1-3):** Ramp with mana dorks (Birds of Paradise, Delighted Halfling, Kami of Whispered Hopes) and land tutors (Nature's Lore, Three Visits, Cultivate). Set up value engines like Rhystic Study or Mystic Remora.

**Mid Game (Turns 4-6):** Cast Hakbal as soon as possible. Each combat, all Merfolk explore, digging for lands or placing +1/+1 counters. Use Hakbal's attack trigger to either put a land onto the battlefield or draw a card. Develop the board with Merfolk lords (Lord of Atlantis, Master of the Pearl Trident) and counter amplifiers (Hardened Scales, Branching Evolution, Doubling Season).

**Late Game (Turns 7+):** Overwhelm opponents with large, evasive Merfolk. Use Overwhelming Stampede or Herald of Secret Streams to push through damage. Alternatively, win via Simic Ascendancy by accumulating growth counters through prolific +1/+1 counter placement and proliferate effects (Evolution Sage, Ripples of Potential).

### Mulligan Priorities

**Keep:** Hands with 2-3 lands (including green and blue sources), early ramp (a mana dork or land tutor), and a path to cast Hakbal by turn 4.

**Avoid:** Hands with no early plays, only high-cost cards, or lacking both colors. Prioritize consistency over explosive starts.

B3 — no infinites. **Game changers:** Rhystic Study, Cyclonic Rift, The One Ring. **Tutors:** Green Sun's Zenith.

## Key Synergies

- **Hakbal + explore** — every Merfolk gets +1/+1 or puts a land in hand each combat. Topography Tracker makes each explore happen twice. Roaming Throne (choosing Merfolk) causes Hakbal's beginning of combat trigger to happen twice, resulting in each Merfolk exploring twice per combat when combined.
- **Counter doublers** (Hardened Scales, Branching Evolution, Doubling Season) — multiply every +1/+1 counter placed. Each explore trigger becomes 2–4 counters.
- **Evolution Sage** — landfall → proliferate → grow everything that already has counters. Extra land drops (Azusa) feed both explore and proliferate.
- **Herald of Secret Streams** — creatures with +1/+1 counters are unblockable. Turns a stacked board into lethal out of nowhere.
- **Reflections of Littjara** (choose Merfolk) — copy every Merfolk spell as a token. Doubles your board for free.
- **Kindred Discovery** (choose Merfolk) — draw on every Merfolk enter/attack. Massive card advantage engine.
- **Kodama of the West Tree** — modified creatures (anything with +1/+1 counters) have trample; land on combat damage.
- **The Ozolith** — saves counters when creatures die. Nothing is wasted on board wipes.
- **Wonder in GY** — all your creatures gain flying. Get it in the yard via mill, loot, or chump block.
- **Sin, Unending Cataclysm** — steals counters from the board, enters huge, shuffles back when it dies. Finisher that recycles itself.
- **Simic Ascendancy** — alternative win condition at 20+ growth counters; grows passively with every +1/+1 placed. Can be achieved quickly with doubling effects and proliferate. Keep track of growth counters and protect the enchantment.
- **Thrasios, Triton Hero** — flexible mana sink for late-game value, card advantage, and land drops.

## Notes

- **Mana base:** 36 lands (1 Boseiju, Who Endures
1 Waterlogged Grove
1 Alchemist's Refuge
9 Forest, 1 Minamo, School at Water's Edge
1 Dreamroot Cascade
10 Island, 12 nonbasic). Even GU split. Fetches: Misty Rainforest, Verdant Catacombs, Prismatic Vista. Duals: Breeding Pool. Utility: Plaza of Heroes, Otawara, Reliquary Tower.
- **Extra land drops** (Azusa) + explore putting lands in hand = ramp while growing creatures. The explore mechanic is both mana development and creature growth.
- **Green Sun's Zenith** — flexible creature tutor. Finds Nicanzil, Kodama, Evolution Sage, Herald, or any green creature for the situation.
- **9 counterspells** for stack protection — Counterspell, Mana Drain, Pact of Negation, Offer You Can't Refuse, Vodalian Hexcatcher (repeatable), Veil of Summer (anti-blue/black), plus protection instants. This is a proactive deck that holds up selective interaction.
- **Removal package** (Cyclonic Rift, Beast Within, Pongify, Return to Nature) — answers creatures, artifacts, and enchantments. Return to Nature provides critical answers to Solemnity and Cursed Totem, plus graveyard hate mode.
- **Power Level:** 5.0-5.5 (optimized casual). Wins primarily through combat around turns 8-10. Speed: 5/10, Resilience: 6/10, Consistency: 7/10, Interaction: 7/10.

## Weaknesses

### Critical

- **Board Wipes:** Mass removal (especially exile like Farewell) cripples the creature-based strategy. Without a board, the deck struggles to rebuild quickly.
- **Anti-Counter Hate:** Solemnity completely shuts down +1/+1 counters, nullifying many synergies and win conditions.
- **Activated Ability Stoppers:** Cursed Totem and Linvala, Keeper of Silence disable key mana dorks (Kami of Whispered Hopes) and other activated abilities.

### Moderate

- **Lack of Haste:** Relies on equipment for haste; summoning sickness can delay pressure and explore triggers.
- **Commander Dependence:** While the deck can function without Hakbal, his absence significantly slows down value generation and consistency.
- **Limited Tutoring:** Aside from Green Sun's Zenith, the deck lacks tutors for non-creature pieces, making it reliant on drawing into key enchantments or artifacts.

### Minor

- **Color Requirements:** Some cards require double blue or double green, but the mana base is robust enough to support them.
- **Graveyard Reliance:** Minimal recursion means exiled pieces are difficult to recover.
