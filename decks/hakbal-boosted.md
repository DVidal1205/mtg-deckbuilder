## Strategy

1. **Ramp and stick Hakbal** — Fast mana + green land ramp. Protect with Greaves, Boots, Tamiyo's Safekeeping, Snakeskin Veil, Heroic Intervention, Veil of Summer, and countermagic (Counterspell, Mana Drain, Pact of Negation).
2. **Attack → every Merfolk explores** — Each combat, every Merfolk gets +1/+1 or draws a land. Counter doublers (Hardened Scales, Branching Evolution, Doubling Season) and Ozoliths amplify growth. Evolution Sage proliferates on every land drop. Nicanzil doubles explore triggers.
3. **Close the game** — Herald of Secret Streams makes creatures with +1/+1 counters unblockable. Overwhelming Stampede gives +X/+X and trample to the team. Alternatively, grind with Kindred Discovery + Rhystic Study card advantage into a massive board.

B3 — no infinites. **Game changers:** Rhystic Study, Cyclonic Rift, The One Ring. **Tutors:** Green Sun's Zenith.

## Key Synergies

- **Hakbal + explore** — every Merfolk gets +1/+1 or puts a land in hand each combat. Nicanzil doubles all explore triggers.
- **Counter doublers** (Hardened Scales, Branching Evolution, Doubling Season) — multiply every +1/+1 counter placed. Each explore trigger becomes 2–4 counters.
- **Evolution Sage** — landfall → proliferate → grow everything that already has counters. Extra land drops (Azusa) feed both explore and proliferate.
- **Herald of Secret Streams** — creatures with +1/+1 counters are unblockable. Turns a stacked board into lethal out of nowhere.
- **Reflections of Littjara** (choose Merfolk) — copy every Merfolk spell as a token. Doubles your board for free.
- **Kindred Discovery** (choose Merfolk) — draw on every Merfolk enter/attack. Massive card advantage engine.
- **Kodama of the West Tree** — modified creatures (anything with +1/+1 counters) have trample; land on combat damage.
- **The Ozolith** — saves counters when creatures die. Nothing is wasted on board wipes.
- **Wonder in GY** — all your creatures gain flying. Get it in the yard via mill, loot, or chump block.
- **Sin, Unending Cataclysm** — steals counters from the board, enters huge, shuffles back when it dies. Finisher that recycles itself.
- **Simic Ascendancy** — alternative win condition at 20+ growth counters; grows passively with every +1/+1 placed.

## Notes

- **Mana base:** 36 lands (1 Boseiju, Who Endures
1 Waterlogged Grove
1 Alchemist's Refuge
9 Forest, 1 Minamo, School at Water's Edge
1 Dreamroot Cascade
10 Island, 12 nonbasic). Even GU split. Fetches: Misty Rainforest, Verdant Catacombs, Prismatic Vista. Duals: Breeding Pool. Utility: Plaza of Heroes, Otawara, Reliquary Tower.
- **Extra land drops** (Azusa) + explore putting lands in hand = ramp while growing creatures. The explore mechanic is both mana development and creature growth.
- **Green Sun's Zenith** — flexible creature tutor. Finds Nicanzil, Kodama, Evolution Sage, Herald, or any green creature for the situation.
- **7 counterspells** for stack protection — Counterspell, Mana Drain, Pact of Negation, Veil of Summer (anti-blue/black), plus protection instants. This is a proactive deck that holds up selective interaction.
- **Removal is light** (Cyclonic Rift, Beast Within, Pongify) — the plan is to outgrow opponents, not control them.
