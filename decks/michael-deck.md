## Strategy

Play this as an Esper lifegain-midrange deck first, control deck second. Oloro gives guaranteed life every turn cycle, and the deck is built to convert those triggers into creature growth, drain, tokens, and card advantage.

1. **Develop lifegain creatures early** (Soul Warden effects, Daxos, Kambal) to start compounding triggers.
2. **Snowball payoffs** (Karlov, Voice, Ajani's Pridemate, Vito, Cliffhaven Vampire, Archangel of Thune).
3. **Finish with lifegain payoffs** (Aetherflux Reservoir, Exsanguinate, Sanguine Bond/Exquisite Blood pressure, massive combat boards).

B3 profile: optimized manabase and interaction, but the core plan is creature-based lifegain pressure.
EDHREC high-synergy validates this plan around Sanguine Bond, Aetherflux Reservoir, Vito, Soul Warden effects, and life-multiplier pieces.

## Key Synergies

- **Soul Warden / Soul's Attendant / Authority / Daxos** gives constant life triggers in multiplayer.
- **Karlov + repeated lifegain** turns every turn cycle into removal pressure.
- **Archangel of Thune / Heliod / Voice / Ajani's Pridemate** converts life gain into board growth.
- **Vito / Cliffhaven / Marauding Blight-Priest / Queza** turns life gain and card draw into damage.
- **Rhox Faithmender + Oloro** doubles passive life and supercharges all payoffs.

## Notes

- **Primary identity:** lifegain creatures and payoffs, not draw-go control.
- **Game changers (3):** Rhystic Study, Smothering Tithe, Teferi's Protection.
- **No dedicated combo/tutor plan:** wins primarily through lifegain engines and payoffs.
- **Interaction shell:** enough stack and board control to protect creature engines.
